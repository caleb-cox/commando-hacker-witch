## What is Commando, Hacker & Witch?
CH&W is a simple, lightweight role playing game that allows a group of players and a game master (GM) to experience epic adventures in a retro-cyberpunk world of hackers, machine guns, and (inexplicably) magic.

Although CH&W uses the three archetypal roles of classic role playing games in its title, it doesn’t make use of classes. Players can freely create characters as they see fit without having to press them into the tight corset of character classes. Commando, Hacker and Witch are actually the characters’ basic attributes, which measure their capabilities in combat, stealth and academics respectively.

This book assumes you are familiar with tabletop RPGs. If you have no idea how a tabletop role playing game is supposed to work, ask your geek friends; they’ll probably know.

## Characters
Each player has to create a character in order to play. The player character is his or her representation in the game world. The characters played by the game master are called non-player characters orNPCs. All characters in CH&W are described by their three basic attributes, skills, talents and various other values, which will be explained in detail in this chapter.

Each player has to create a character in order to play. The player character is his or her representation in the game world. The characters played by the game master are called non-player characters or NPCs. All characters in CH&W are described by their three basic attributes, skills, talents and various other values, which will be explained in detail in this chapter.

### Attributes
CH&W uses three basic attributes to describe a character: Commando, Hacker and Witch. Each attribute is usually ranked from 0 to 6, but monsters and veteran characters may have higher values. If an attribute is ranked at 0 you can't use any related skills. And in the case of the Witch attribute you can't cast even the simplest spell.

- A character with a high rank in **Commando** is the born fighter: strong, tough, fearless.
- Someone with a high **Hacker** attribute is witty, stealthy and quick with their feet and mind. 
- A highly ranked **Witch** attribute is a sign of wisdom, strength of will and occult knowledge.

Each player character starts with 10 attribute levels that may be freely distributed between the three attributes. No attribute may start higher than 6 though. While highly specialized characters are possible, a well-rounded character with a few levels in each attribute probably works best for new players.

### Health, Luck and Mana
Health are a measure of how many hits a character may sustain before going down. A character with 0 health is considered dead or dying. Luck can be used to save one's life in certain situations, or take over some narrative control from the GM. Mana is the raw magical energy that is used by Witchs to cast magic spells. Characters can't perform any magic when their Mana is depleted.

Each character starts with Hipoints equal to 6 plus his Commando attribute, Luck equal to his Hacker attribute and Mana equal to two times his Witch attribute. You start with at least 1 Luck if your Hacker attribute is at level 0, though.

### Armor and Defense
Each character has a Defense stat that is equal to 4 plus half the sum of his Commando and Hacker attributes rounded down. Worn armor and shields grants a bonus to Defense but raise the Mana cost of spells by their Armor Penalty (AP).

### Skills
Each character is also further detailed by a couple of skills. Skills are abilities a character has learned over the years like Riding or Thievery. Skills are not ranked like attributes though. You either have learned a skill, or you don't. Each character starts with three skills of the players choice. Please note that you can't choose a skill if the relevant attribute is ranked at level 0!

## Magic
### Using Magic
Characters with a Witch attribute of 1 or higher have access to spells. Spells can be found or bought. These spells must first be transferred to a character's personal spell book before they can be used. To cast a spell from the book, the character has to make a roll versus the DL or the spell. If successful, his mana pool is reduced by the amount listed for the spell.

### Mana regeneration
A character gets back his full mana pool for a good night's sleep and receives mana equal to his Witch attribute for one hour of meditation.

### Casting Spells
In order to cast spells a character needs at least Witch level 1. The range of all spells is the line of sight if the spell description does not say otherwise.

Spells are divided between cantrips and rituals. Cantrips are the easiest to cast and least powerful, available to anyone with the relevant skill (Charms, Divination, Herbalism, or Hexes). Rituals are significantly stronger spells only available to casters with the Pact talent.

### Mana burning
A spell caster may choose to burn additional mana to improve the spell's effects. Each level of mana burn costs half the initial mana cost and raises the spells DL by one. The effects of the mana burn are listed with each spells description. Please note that you have to use mana from your personal pool for mana burning even if you cast a spell from an implement.

### Sustaining spells
Usually all spells have a certain duration or cause an instant effect. But there may be cases when a caster wants to sustain a spell over longer periods of time. If a spell can be sustained, it's listed in the spells description. In order to sustain a spell over longer period of time, the caster has to concentrate which penalizes all of his actions by a modifier of -1. The mana cost for sustaining the spell is listed with the spell's description. 

## Spell List
### Cantrips
#### Frostburn
Touch attack that causes 1d6-2 damage. Each level of mana burn raises the damage by +1.

#### Healing Hand
Heals 1d6 health. The caster has to touch the person he wants to heal. Each level of mana burn heals an additional health.

#### Magic light
Caster creates a magic light on the tip of his staff or other weapon, that illuminates a 10 yards radius much like a torch. Mana burn can be used to add one or more of the following effects:

- Ball of light (the caster forms the light into a ball that he can control with his thoughts)
- Colored light (the light shines in a color of the caster's choosing)
- Light beam (the light shines in a tight beam which reaches 15 yards)
- Flash (the effect lasts only one round but blinds everyone who looks unprotected into the flash for 1d6 rounds)

The magic light shines for 1 hour or until dispelled by the caster. It can also be sustained for 1 additional mana per hour.

#### Sense Magic
Caster can sense magic in a 3 yards radius. Each level of mana burn adds another yard to the radius.

#### Telekinesis
Caster may remotely move one item up to 1kg. Each mana burn adds another kilogram of weight that can be moved. Telekinesis lasts for 1 min and can be sustained for 1 additional mana per minute.

## Rules Mechanics
### Basic Task Resolution
Every time a character wants to perform an action which has a chance of failing, the GM may ask the player to roll the dice to determine the outcome of said action. The basic task resolution method is the attribute check. The GM picks the appropriate attribute and decides how difficult the task at hand is. Then the player rolls one six-sided die (also called d6) and adds the relevant attribute's level to the roll's result. If the character knows any skills that might help in that situation, he may add 2 to his result. The final result is then compared to the difficulty level set by the GM. If the result is equal or higher the task was successful. If not, the task failed.

Optional: If a character knows more than one skill that could be used in a given situation, the GM may allow the player to add another 2 to the result.

#### Exploding die
Whenever a player rolls a 6, the die may "explode". This means, the player may roll again and add the second result. If the second result is another 6, you roll again. Only damage rolls and attribute checks where the character owns an appropriate skill are subject to this rule.

#### Automatic success
When the risk of failing is extremely low, or the task is only of minor importance to the story, and the character has the appropriate skill, the GM may decide that no roll is necessary.

#### Unopposed check
If the task at hand is not actively opposed, the player has to beat a difficulty level determined by the GM.

- Difficulty (DL)
- Easy (5)
- Routine (7)
- Challenging (9)
- Hard (11)
- Extreme (13)

#### Opposed check
When two characters are in direct competition, the opposed check method is used. The DL of the active character is determined by a roll made by the passive character. 

Example: A thief wants to sneak past a guard unnoticed. The guard then rolls a d6 and adds his Witch attribute and the +2 bonus if he owns the Awareness skill to the result. This result then is the DL for the thief's attribute check.

Optional: Instead of rolling, you can just add 3 to the relevant attribute (and the skill bonus) to get the DL.

#### Circumstantial modifiers
There are circumstances which can make tasks harder or easier to perform than usual: The lack of tools makes it harder to craft something, a master crafted weapon grants a bonus to an attack, or bad lighting conditions make it easier to hide in the shadows. The GM may add circumstantial modifiers to any DL if appropriate.

### Using Luck
A character can spend one of his Luck points to do the following (GM approval needed): 

- Ignore an attack that would have killed the character
- Change a minor detail in the game world. For example: your character knows the NPC you’ve just met. Or there is a shop in the town you just entered with the equipment you need.
- Reroll a single die roll or add +2 to a single check

Luck doesn't regenerate automatically, so players are advised not to waste their Luck. GMs are meant to grant players Luck for heroic actions, good role playing and certain goals their characters achieved.

## Combat
### Initiative
Whenever combat occurs, player characters and non-player characters act in turns. At the start of combat, the sequence in which the two sides in the conflict act is determined. This is called initiative. In most cases common sense dictates the initiative. If unsure roll a die for each side. The side with the higher result acts first.

Optional: A character with the Awareness skill may add +2 to the initiative roll.

### Combat actions
Combat turns are pretty short, so characters can only perform a few actions. Running a short distance, drawing a weapon, attacking a foe, casting a spell are reasonable actions that can be performed during one turn.

### Attack roll
When a character tries to hit another character in close or ranged combat, his player has to roll the dice to determine if he has hit. Attack rolls work like any other attribute check but the DL is always the target's Defense stat plus any applicable modifiers. Attack rolls are subject to the "exploding die" rule if the character has the appropriate skill and that each additional success after the first adds +1 to the damage caused. Please refer to the Magic chapter for magic attacks.

Example: A thief wants to backstab a guard with a dagger. The skill list determines that when using a dagger the Hacker attribute applies. The thief knows this skill, so he may also add the +2 modifier to his attack roll.

### Damage and Healing
After having scored a hit, you determine the damage caused. Damage is determined by the weapon used. See the weapon list for details. Please note that damage rolls are always subject to the "exploding die" rule. The victims health are reduced by a number of points equal to the damage caused. If the health drop to 0, the character is dead or dying. A character's health may never drop below 0.

Optional: Characters who were reduced to under half their maximum health are considered seriously wounded and get a -3 modifier on all checks.

A character heals health equal to his highest attribute per day of rest. Only light activities are allowed during that time. If a character takes part in a combat, chase or a similar activity he may only heal a single health that day. Characters with the Herbalism skill may use his abilities to speed up healing. When treated by such a character, you get +2 Healths per day of rest.
